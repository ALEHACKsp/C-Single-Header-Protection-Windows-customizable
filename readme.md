So yea the description cut off so here we go. <br />
I got bored in online class so I made this...<br />
I know its shit but its noob friendly (Friendly for myself lol) and easy to set up and customizable.

<br />


To "start" the protection just type "Protect();" into your code. <br />
<br />
You can also customize the protection inside the header file. <br />
<br />
Line 1-7 are bools which you can modify to match what you want...<br />
The BSOD and AntiDump module booth dont work atm... <br />
But I am planning on fixing them / creating them <br />
<br />
I will try to keep all this single headed (1x .hpp file only)<br />
